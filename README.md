## Description

This Tech Blog application is a CMS-style blog site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts as well. When the user creates an account and logs in, they're directed to the Home page, where they can access all the posts made by them or other developers. The user may add comments to the posts and view others' comments as well. On the Dashboard page, the user can fill in a form to create a post, and once they do so, their post will show up below. They may also delete their post. If they decide to logout, they may stil view all posts, but cannot create posts nor comment on them.
